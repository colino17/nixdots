# NIXOS SETUP

Personal NIXOS device setup stack.

## USAGE
This is a personal repo that I use to manage my NixOS Configs for my various devices. Device level setup guides can be found in the devices subfolder along with the main configuration files for each of those devices. There is also a custom bash script for pulling down updates from this repo. Once the system is bootstrapped there is a bash alias ("get") for doing this.

As this is a personal repo it is not particulary useful for others, however it could be forked and used as a framework for your own NixOS setup with the appropriate modifications.

## TODO
- Fix Gnome Tiling and Hotkeys
- Create .apps and .scripts folders
- Pull down apps and scripts
- Investigate universal config variables (wallpaper, neofetch, stateversion)
- Split homes
